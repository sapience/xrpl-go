# wallet

## Overview

The `wallet` package contains the types and functions to work and manage your XRPL accounts. Either you want to create a new account, or you want to sign transactions, this package has you covered.

This package enables you to do the following actions:

- Generate new wallets using a seed, mnemonic or random.
- Sign and multisign transactions.
- Access to wallet's public and private keys and address.

## Generating a wallet

In order to generate a new wallet, you can either use a **seed**, a **mnemonic** or generate a **random** one. Here are the constructors available:

```go
// Wallet constructors
func New(alg interfaces.CryptoImplementation) (Wallet, error)
func FromSeed(seed string, masterAddress string) (Wallet, error)
func FromSecret(seed string) (Wallet, error)
func FromMnemonic(mnemonic string) (*Wallet, error)
```

:::info

When generating a random wallet, you will need to specify the algorithm you want to use.
`xrpl-go` library provides the package `crypto` that exports `ed25519` and `secp256k1` algorithms which satisfy the `CryptoImplementation` interface.
You can use the `crypto` package by importing it in your project:

```go
import "github.com/xrpl-go/pkg/crypto"
```

:::warning

When initializing a wallet from a seed, remember that only seeds generated by `ed25519` and `secp256k1` algorithms are supported. Learn more about XRPL cryptographic keys in the [official documentation](https://xrpl.org/docs/concepts/accounts/cryptographic-keys).

## Signing and multisigning transactions

A wallet lets the developer sign and multisign transactions easily. The `Wallet` type exposes the following signing methods:

```go
// Signing methods
func (w *Wallet) Sign(tx map[string]interface{}) (string, string, error)
func (w *Wallet) Multisign(tx map[string]interface{}) (string, string, error)
```

The `Sign` method signs a [flat transaction](Afegir link) and returns the signed transaction blob and the signature.

On the other hand, the `Multisign` method multisigns a flat transaction by adding the wallet's signature to the transaction and returning the resulting transaction blob and the blob hash. Learn more about how multisigns work in the [official documentation](https://xrpl.org/docs/concepts/accounts/multi-signing).

## Usage

In this section, we will see how to generate a `Wallet`, call the faucet to get XRP, and send the XRP to another account.
First step is to generate a `Wallet` using the `New` constructor (in this case, we will use the `ed25519` algorithm):

```go
wallet, err := wallet.New(crypto.ED25519())
if err != nil {
    // ...
}
```
Once we have the `Wallet`, we can call the faucet to get XRP. For this example, we will use the `DevnetFaucetProvider` to get XRP on the `devnet` ledger:

```go
devnetFaucet := faucet.NewDevnetFaucetProvider()

err := devnetFaucet.FundWallet(wallet.ClassicAddress)
if err != nil {
    // ...
}
```

Once we have the XRP, we can create a `Payment` transaction. For this example, we will send the XRP to the `rJ96831v5JXxna35JYvsW9VRmENwq23ib9` account.

```go
payment := transaction.Payment{
    BaseTx: transaction.BaseTx{
        Account: wallet.ClassicAddress,
    },
    Destination: "rJ96831v5JXxna35JYvsW9VRmENwq23ib9",
    Amount:      types.XRPCurrencyAmount(10000000),
    DeliverMax:  types.XRPCurrencyAmount(10000000),
}
```

Finally, we can sign the flat payment transaction:

```go
blob, hash, err := wallet.Sign(payment.Flatten())
if err != nil {
    // ...
}
```

Summarizing, the complete code to generate a wallet, call the faucet to get XRP, create a payment transaction and sign it is the following:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"

	"github.com/Peersyst/xrpl-go/pkg/crypto"
	"github.com/Peersyst/xrpl-go/xrpl/transaction"
	"github.com/Peersyst/xrpl-go/xrpl/transaction/types"
	"github.com/Peersyst/xrpl-go/xrpl/wallet"
)

func main() {
	wallet, err := wallet.New(crypto.ED25519())
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	payment := transaction.Payment{
		BaseTx: transaction.BaseTx{
			Account: wallet.ClassicAddress,
		},
		Destination: "rJ96831v5JXxna35JYvsW9VRmENwq23ib9",
		Amount:      types.XRPCurrencyAmount(10000000),
		DeliverMax:  types.XRPCurrencyAmount(10000000),
	}

	blob, hash, err := wallet.Sign(payment.Flatten())
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	fmt.Println("Tx blob: ", blob)
	fmt.Println("Tx hash: ", hash)
}
```
